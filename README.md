termpy
======

TermPy - simple terminal for *nix systems X Windows with ability to show
pictures.

TermPy is based on vte, gtk and python. It should work environments with
GTK support and on POSIX-compliant systems (tested on Debian and Solaris).
POSIX-compliance is needed only for executing ps command.

Usage: launch ./term.py.

Then try: './show your_image.jpg' or 'cat your_image.png | ./show'
You can add show in your $PATH.

Since VTE used, TermPy supports CTRL+INS, SHIFT+INS and copying by pressing
wheel mouse button.

Issues are appreciated. You may post them on GitHub.

With best regards,
Sazonov Andrey

P.S. THANKS TO AUTHORS OF GTK, VTE AND PYTHON.
