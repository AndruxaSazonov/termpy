termpy
======

TermPy - simple terminal for *nix systems, based on vte, gtk and python.
To try it please download next two files:
1. show,
2. term.py

Do chmod +x on these two files.
You can add show in your $PATH.

Usage: launch ./term.py. 
Then try:
./show your_image.jpg
or
cat your_image.jpg | ./show

NOTE: This is ALPHA version of TermPy!
If 'show' hangs up - click Enter key once. This is known bug, sorry. Not yet fixed.
