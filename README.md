termpy
======

TermPy - simple terminal for *nix systems X Windows with ability to show pictures. TermPy is based on vte, gtk and python.
It should work in Gnome environment on POSIX-compliant systems (tested on Debian and Solaris).

Usage: launch ./term.py.
Then try: './show your_image.jpg' or 'cat your_image.png | ./show'
You can add show in your $PATH.

Because VTE used, TermPy supports CTRL+INS, SHIFT+INS and copying by pressing wheel mouse button.

Issues are appreciated. You map post them on GitHub.

With best regards,
Sazonov Andrey

P.S. THANKS TO AUTHORS OF GTK, VTE AND PYTHON.
